# README Generator
 
 ## Description 
This application is a README.md generator that automates the process of creating a README.md file by skipping the steps of creating badges, adding headers, and creating a table of contents. It makes creating README.md files a lot easier. The application uses Node.js and npm. It is entirely written in JavaScript. The very README.md file that you are reading right now was generated by this program!
